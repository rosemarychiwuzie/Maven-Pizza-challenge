# Introduction
The Maven Plato pizza dataset contains 4 csv files representing a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.
-  Recommended Analysis
- what days and times do we tend to be busiest
- How many pizzas are we making during peak periods
- what are our best and worst selling pizzas
- what is our average order value


- Tools used for analysis
Microsoft Excel: I utilized Ms Excel to view the datasets and properly understand the parameters of the data. I also performed some cleaning to make the dataset alot easier to work with/analyse
PostgreSQL: This is a great tool for retrieving data of which i used in performing detailed analysis with the aid of the operators, general SQL syntax to retrieve the necessary data
Power BI: The microsoft Business intelligence tool was very helpful in my visualization process. I imported the datasets into Power BI and created a singular dashboard that is clear and visually appealing
